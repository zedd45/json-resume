Chris has actively been engaged with AutoTraderclassics development and its maintenance phase. As a technical go-to UIE engineer, his knowledge of application development and the ATX business is extensive. On many occasions I’ve dropped by his desk for help on ATX or Dealer legacy code and he has never hesitated to help me out or point me in the right direction. Chris’s input has proved highly valuable to me on and off the office floor. \n From my understanding of ATC and the complexities in its architecture, it is clear that Chris endeavors to improve code quality and make the development process more efficient. Additionally, I’ve seen that his expertise extends into the architecture domain featuring industrial strength PHP frameworks where I've seen him take extra measures to oversee his work from an end-to-end perspective on projects.
